# OpinionMining
Social Media service that assigns a score based on sentiment analysis of the public's replies.

Right now, it takes in a YouTube ChannelID and parses through the last x amount of comments and applies a score of sentiment to each comment that effects the overall score of the channel.

Only supports YouTube Channels right now, but will hopefully be able to access more social platforms in the future.
